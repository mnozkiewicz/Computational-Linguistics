# Computational-Linguistics

Repository contains solutions for the tasks from Computational-Linguistics (smarter-sounding name for Natural Language Processing) course at AGH.
The laboratory descritpions are available [here](https://github.com/apohllo/computational-linguistics).

## Course topics

| Lab | Topics | Summary of Work |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Lab 1** | RNNs and Transformers | Trained and compared models for next token prediction task. One model was based on Transformer (decoder only) architecture and the other on LSTM network. Both trained from scratch (or at least tried learning).
